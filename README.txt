All of the files, bio.html, index.html, resume.html, and 
index_style.css, work as intended and display properly.
Since all of the fles successfully pass their respective
file validators, it is reasonable to say that they are
correctly implemented. Since these are the only files
in the assignment other than an image and this README,
nothing seems to have been implemented incorrectly.

I did not collaborate or discuss this assignment with
anyone, and I spent about 3-4 hours on this assignment.
