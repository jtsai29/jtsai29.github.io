For this assignment, I decided to use 
styling just on the index.html file. I figured that
the resume and bio would not have a large amount
of styling to it because a resume would need to look
more professional (so I believed it should not have
varied colors) and the bio just does not have that many
elements in it. So, in the index.html file, I decided
to add colors to different elements and align the text
as well. All of that was accomplished in the index_style.css
file.

The HTML files were written very plainly and mostly made use
of heading and paragraph elements. The index.html file also
used an image and link references to the other pages. Other
than these elements, the files themselves are on the rather
simple side.

For the content of the bio.html and resume.html page, I used
my actual information except for my name. The image on the
index.html image is also not an actual photo of myself.
